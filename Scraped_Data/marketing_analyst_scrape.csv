Virtual interviews via web portals or phone may be offered as deemed appropriate and feasible by the hiring manager – standard in-person interviews will still be offered if conditions permit.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a third of California’s population qualified as low-income. The fraction of qualified customers has increased significantly with layoffs during pandemic. The climate crisis also requires an evolution of our electric grid, and CPUC policies must also tackle the challenge of designing a reliable, affordable, and safe transformation of the electric grid to carbon-free in California. The Residential Programs and Portfolio Approval section’s responsibility includes approval of the state efficiency portfolio for all customer segments. More specifically, we review and approve of California’s income qualified assistance program administrators’ proposed strategies and budget for achieving goals for a) enrolling eligible customers in bill savings programs, and b) energy savings and hardship reduction for customers in need. More broadly we evaluate the role of income qualified programs in supporting the state to reach our state carbon-free goals equitably. The income qualified and energy efficiency program administrators regulated by the Commission include large and small investor owned electric and gas utilities.

The analyst will lead the low income needs assessment (LINA) study to inform future proposals for setting regulatory policies. This effort entails stakeholder development to solicit input and provide transparency to build awareness, trust, and consensus among a stakeholder community and coordination of individuals across multiple organizations. The LINA study looks specifically at how programs can best be designed to efficiently and effectively serve that need. The analyst’s activities will inform and facilitate greater effectiveness of existing programs. For example, additional assigned duties may include working with program administrators to encourage:
Collaboration with external stakeholders and community-based organizations on innovations in marketing and outreach to ensure eligible customers’ awareness, access, and participation in programs.
Use of sophisticated data processing to identify those customers in greatest need that are not yet enrolled and analyze why.
Assessing policies and making recommendations based on data analysis to ease of enrollment to energy bill savings programs, and minimizing attrition of eligible customers.
Maintenance and updates of verification models to appropriately ensure that customers enrolled in bill savings programs are indeed eligible.
In these efforts, the analyst will collaborate with state and local government agencies that have a shared mission in serving income qualified residential customers essential services at rates they can afford. The analyst will also collaborate with other divisions across the CPUC with the goal of leveraging customer programs to support the state reaching customers in greatest need so that carbon-free goals may be met in an equitable manner. For example, through leveraging knowledge and methods from other government programs such as Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and CalFresh, as well as identifying and prioritizing customers in greatest need, such as disconnected customers, and future opportunities, such as solar generation and battery storage, the analyst is more effectively able to reach and serve low income customers’ needs.

In general, the Analyst’s role in policy development includes developing original and impartial policy options; soliciting, reviewing, summarizing, and incorporating stakeholder input or proposals, and compiling data and presenting analytical evidence in support or rebuttal of options or proposals. The staff’s role in policy implementation includes proactive anticipation of risks and challenges. Finally, to identify gaps and inconsistencies in policy’s effectiveness, the analyst ensures data is collected for evaluation of the success of decision directed activities against the intended goal to inform future policy development.

We're starting by reinventing insurance, by rethinking the technologies that enable it, but our true goal is to build a platform that rewards people for driving well — creating safer roads with fewer accidents in the process.

Backed by impressive funding, we're poised to re-engineer a trillion-dollar category, and that’s just the beginning. We’re using rich customer insights, advanced technology and data science to build our cloud-native InsurTech solution, and other things we haven’t even dreamt up yet. We're out to change behavior and promote mindful living at a societal level. But the key to us being successful in our mission isn’t just about nailing the technology—it’s about hiring the talented people who can help us make a quantifiable impact in the world. We’re growing our world-class team.

And that’s where you come in.

The Role
The Sr. Lifecycle Marketing Specialist helps plan strategic communications and data-driven campaigns across channels and key touch points, including email, push notifications, SMS, and direct mail. Your role is responsible for the continuous enhancement of our email campaigns and customer comms to drive growth, activation, and increase customer relationships and loyalty while partnering closely with marketing and product teams across growth initiatives.

Working within the cross-discipline growth team, you will be responsible for planning, executing, analyzing and optimizing lifecycle strategies while serving as a subject matter expert for omni-channel communication. With an orientation around our target customer experience and generating measurable engagements that drive short and long-term business results. The ideal candidate has a data-driven analytical mindset, a passion for understanding the customer journey, and has worked on complex lifecycle and nurture programs.
About You:
You’ve travelled many roads within the marketing practice—from retail to ecommerce and SaaS start-ups—delivered results and helped grow a profitable customer base and kept them engaged with strategic and experimental growth tactics. But you’re not one to rest on your laurels or driven by an ego. Instead, your passion for your craft, curious mind, and desire to see your team succeed fuels a broad interest in marketing that delivers results.
You have an entrepreneurial spirit and thrive on helping shape capabilities within a growing business. And you can leverage all your passion and acumen to deliver results with your team — be it email campaigns that promote organic referrals or build personalized nurturing journeys that convert. When it comes to the brand and customer, you understand these impact our success as much as business optimization.

Key Qualities:

You’re a hybrid with a passion for performance-driven marketing and branding. You understand that creating great marketing requires experimentation and meaningful measurement to achieve business results. But you’re also a master of the marketing craft, understanding the brand, the industry and what drives purchase decisions—and ultimately acquires great customers with high LTV. Whether extending brand campaigns through communication channels or working with research teams to interpret performance results, you know firsthand how to bridge the gap between a business strategy and building a community of engaged and passionate customers. Which you’ve done repeatedly. And you know that it takes teamwork to do it successfully.
You're a fantastic communicator with strong technical acumen. Both within your team, and without, you have to be able to give voice to your vision, and present your ideas effectively and objectively. And you’re ready to listen and learn too. Importantly, you understand how to take an idea and implement it, because you have extensive knowledge of ESP and CRM platforms. One moment you’re teaching the team how to create CTAs that convert and the next you’re optimizing email templates for automated email nurturing journeys.
You're a low ego collaborator and competent leader. You understand that without a multidisciplinary team to give campaigns life, an idea is worthless. You understand how to bring the creative team and technical team together to work seamlessly as a well-oiled optimized marketing machine, because you are as much a conductor as a collaborator. You also recognize the need to take a particular path, as you understand what the data is telling us and can guide the team toward optimized results.
You work with energy and passion for your craft. Branding, technology and the analytics space are your lifeblood and you inspire your teammates and compel them to produce performance driven marketing. You want to work where you can help shape the culture and have the ability to build something with a group of like-minded individuals that share your passion.
You experiment strategically. You have the ability to deliver great work that also delivers on customer and business needs. You know from experience that being intentional with your approach and experimentation goes much further than random tests for the sake of testing. And you find optimizations that generate results that acquire, retain, upsell and cross-sell customers at the right moment in the lifecycle.
You keep it together. You’re a master housekeeper—organized, methodical and timely. That’s how you stay on top of everything. Specifically, you need to be able to map the engagement into a plan that the team can implement, measure and produce extraordinary results.
You’re an entrepreneur. And with an entrepreneurial spirit, you’re a confident self-starter that has a passion for growing teams, evolving processes, and most importantly culture. In other words, you don’t want to just be a part of the culture, you want to help make it. You recognize that great company cultures come from you and your teammates, your positive attitudes and hard work to shape and nurture healthy and successful companies.
