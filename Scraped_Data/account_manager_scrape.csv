At Dama Financial, we’re bringing financial inclusion to an industry that is one of the largest market opportunities of this decade – cannabis. We’ve spent the past 3 years creating financial solutions that now serve as the building blocks and a financial framework for businesses in the underserved cannabis industry.

Dama Financial was founded by entrepreneurs that have a proven track record of successfully leveraging modern technology to provide financial inclusion to historically unbanked categories. During the past 3 years, Dama’s leadership team has turned their focus to addressing the challenges burdening the cannabis industry – the unbanked category of our time.

We’re seeking hungry self-starters to join our team of optimistic problem solvers. We believe that success is driven by a combination of passion and curiosity which fuels rapid innovation at our Company as we seek to lead the market with best-in-class offerings. If you identify with our mission and have what it takes to add value to our organization, submit your resume today.
An overview of the problem we’re tackling.*
With limited access to financial services, about 70 percent of all cannabis-related businesses (CRBs) use cash for all their transactions. Cash-intensive operations can pose major threats to public safety, incur high costs to properly manage, and be vulnerable to theft. Ten percent of all financial and product loss in the cannabis industry is attributed to external robberies that some businesses attempt to combat with security equipment and armed guards – a costly risk to manage. Even with those safety measures in place, there’s a bigger problem to worry about: employee theft which is believed to contribute to about 90% of all loss in the industry.

From an efficiency perspective, cash ridden CRBs operate at a fundamental disadvantage. With cannabis sales expected to potentially reach $75 billion by 2030, CRBs need to establish a reliable financial framework to thrive.
Our unique positioning enables us to deliver.*
Dama Financial, through its bank partners, provides CRBs with access to transparent and sustainable banking and payment solutions. Using innovative technology, data and artificial intelligence, Dama exceeds the compliance and regulatory requirements for servicing CRBs, bringing legitimacy to the rapidly growing cannabis industry.

Dama’s comprehensive and compliant financial framework offers CRBs the option to maintain cashless operations, reducing their exposure to security risks while improving their business efficiencies and operational focus.
