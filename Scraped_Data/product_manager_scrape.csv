EBAC strives to reduce barriers that contribute to disparities in wellness for socio-economically disadvantaged and racially marginalized families and to create communities where all children and families have support systems to reach their full potential.

EBAC was established in 1952 when a group of parents of children with autism wanted to give their children the same educational and recreational opportunities that contribute to the physical well-being and social growth of all children. From this was born the first day-treatment program west of the Mississippi and was the foundation of growth in meeting the needs of children and families living in the San Francisco Bay Area, and especially in Alameda County.

Today, EBAC’s programs serve over 20,000 children, youth and families throughout Alameda County each year with the goal of giving each child and family the specific resources, skills, and support they need to help them reach their full potential.
